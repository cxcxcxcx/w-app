WARNING:
W-App IS IN ITS EARLY STAGE AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

W-App aims to turn a web application into a real desktop application. By
default, W-App provides a desktop entry and a system tray icon. For more
application specific features, one can use W-App's extension interface to
create your own applications with system notification, automatic log-in, and
whatever you like. You will also be able to download applications created by
others.

Currently, the following applications are included with the package:
* Google Calendar
* Google Mail
* Google Tasks
* Web QQ
* Web Feixin (飞信)

Among them, Web QQ has a customized interface (code mainly comes from another
open source project python-webqq). Customization for other apps are still in
development.

Possible next steps:
* The UI for creating a new application by a URL.
* Shortcuts to call out a application.
* Rewrite the GTK+ codes in Qt and QWebkit.
* A tutorial for creating a new app with customizations.
* Write comments for source codes.

If have suggestions for a feature, or for including another webapp by default,
please do submit a issue. Thanks! 

Acknowledgement:
Currently the codes related to GTK+ and webkit are mainly from python-webqq,
which is available at: http://code.google.com/p/python-webqq/
